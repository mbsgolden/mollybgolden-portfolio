        <p> <span id="p1"> My name is Molly Golden. I am a web developer and designer based in Anchorage, Alaska. </span> <br> Everywhere I go, I am inspired by the designs that shape how we move and interact through the world, whether that is the ecological designs that build our landscape or human designs that shape our experience in our community, in our homes, and on the web. I believe good design can foster connectedness, share stories that reflect on who we are, and foster beauty in the world, including the web.  I strive to create functional web designs that tell a story and inspire beauty in our world. </p>
